#Ian's Instruments Web App Development project for ITSC_3135 at UNCC

<p>This project was created as a semester long exploration of web development tools such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, this project was a way to archive my brother's progression through learning many instruments.

<p>A functioning version of the web app can be accessed at my personal webpage for UNCC here: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/jcarawa2/ian'sInstruments/index.html
